# TextCapture for Godot 4

Cancleing this, it dosent actually work, only some of the text is catpured and the ai can't spot the problem. It will be less work just to find/make a true screen OCR to ascii translator. Maybe as a plugin for the screen shot utility. /sigh

**Capture Godot editor text directly - no screenshots or OCR needed.**

## Why TextCapture?
- ðŸš« **No image processing** - Gets text directly from UI controls
- ðŸ“‹ **Perfect for AI/LLM context** - Share exact editor state with ChatGPT/Gemini
- âš¡ **Faster than OCR** - No GPU/ML required
- ðŸŽ® **Ideal for dev support** - Show UI hierarchy when asking for help

## Features
- One-click copy of visible editor text
- Hierarchical ASCII formatting
- Supports 20+ control types (Buttons, Trees, Editors, etc.)
- Godot 4.3+ compatible

## Installation
1. Copy the `addons/TextCapture` folder to your project
2. Enable in `Project > Project Settings > Plugins`

## Usage
1. Click the ðŸ“‹ button in Godot\'s toolbar
2. Paste anywhere (Ctrl+V) to share:
